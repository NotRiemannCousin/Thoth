![](Thoth-logo.webp "Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and wisdom")

Thoth is a modern C++26 microframework for building both web servers and clients. Powered by the [Hermes](https://github.com/NotRiemannCousin/Hermes) library, Thoth is designed to harness the latest C++ features for creating robust, high-performance web applications.

Inspired by the egyptian god of knowledge, magic and the moon, Thoth embraces a philosophy of strong type safety and compile-time checks without sacrificing usability or elegance. It heavily utilizes coroutines and functional programming concepts to offer a natural and expressive API for asynchronous tasks.
